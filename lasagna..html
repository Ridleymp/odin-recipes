    <h1>How to make homemade lasagna!</h1>
    <img src="c:\Users\WIN_10\Downloads\lasagna.jpg.webp" alt="btw this is lasagna">
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
    A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
    have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    
    <ul><strong>Meat:</strong>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</ul>
    <ul><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Flesh herbs:</strong>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Sugar:</strong>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Spices ans seasonings:</strong>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Noodles:</strong>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Cheese:</strong>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
    <li><strong>make the cheese layer</strong>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
